UNLICENSED:Shanzhai Lyric,Ben Schwartz,https://walkerart.org/magazine/bootlegging-shanzhai-lyric,"Shanzhai Lyric is a “poetic research and archival unit” that documents and transforms awkwardly translated slogans from Chinese bootleg T-shirts into an ongoing poem.  The project exists as a part of Display Distribute, “an itinerant research platform, documentary gesture, distribution service, and sometimes shop in Kowloon, Hong Kong, that takes up thematically the effects of the flows of capital that characterize and shape our world. ” Shanzhai Lyric has gained a large following via the project`s Instagram page and takes on a physical form through various interventions including publications, performance-lectures, and installations.  In the following interview I speak with members of the Shanzhai Lyric project team about bootlegging, global hierarchies, shininess, and the “detritus of consumerism. 
” The name Shanzhai Lyric itself can be read as a kind of bootleg, eliding distinction as an attempt at expressing solidarity with the aesthetic philosophy and politics of this hybrid English while not claiming ownership over the found phrases that we are gathering as our subject.  We are less interested in producing our own bootlegs than in identifying shanzhai strategies and sharing them across various platforms through experiments in publication, performance, curation, archive, installation, and conversation.  Our aim is to place shanzhai lyrics in dialogue with other poetic and artistic lineages that also experiment with mimicry, wordplay, poetic plagiarism, and nonsense as subversive methods.  With The Incomplete Poem we insert shanzhai garments into libraries, art collections, and home closets to comprise an ever-unfinished work, and alongside this we are continuously inserting shanzhai lyrics into publications ranging from poetry zines to fashion magazines to political journals, forming an ongoing piece we call The Endless Garment. 
 Similarly, bringing shanzhai garments into the Women`s Art Library at Goldsmiths situates the pieces within a tradition of feminist experimental text and textile.

Cultivating Care: An Interview with Asad Raza,Hannah Carroll Harris,https://www.berlinartlink.com/2020/09/04/cultivating-care-an-interview-with-asad-raza/,"Rather, his open-ended, site-specific installations supply fertile ground for interaction, ideas and communities to develop.  In his piece `Absorption`, currently on view at Gropius Bau as part of `Down to Earth`, this is quite literally the case.  Twenty tons of artificial neosoil have been installed within the gallery space, cared for by a team of “cultivators” who tend to the soil, raking it, testing its PH levels and gifting it to visitors to nurture their own gardens.  With a background in film-making, Raza composes situations in which to explore our relations with non-human living beings, and each other, with a view to thinking about how we can foster new ways of approaching and caring for these relationships. 
 Whether through a fully-functioning tennis court installed in a 16th Century Milanese church; 26 young flowering trees and their caretakers at the Whitney Biennial; or tons of artificial soil in Sydney and Berlin, his works far exceed the bounds of the walls in which they are situated.  We spoke to Raza about this radiating effect, the role of agency and new ways of thinking about care and kinship in the creative community.  One of the issues I was thinking about was the landscape and how the history of human civilization, in the last few hundred years, has been to break off pieces of the landscape, or to process the landscape into all these different ingredients, these separate components, and then use those components, commodify and distribute them.  What if we set up a new process that was about bringing separate elements, waste products and other components back together and mixing them into a new landscape, into a new soil and then giving it to people? One of the things I really enjoy doing in my work is creating these groups of people, these interactions. 
 We have so many different kinds of people there, and it`s through these groups that I`m trying to create a kind of culture, a culture that belongs to the piece that we all agree on.  It`s a real group and we really are mixing the soil.  This really is a group of people who are mixing these ingredients, found around Berlin, into a new soil.

Asad Raza on Sculpting with Soil,Asad Raza,https://www.frieze.com/article/asad-raza-sculpting-soil,"Soil includes sands, clays and silts as well as bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, arthropods, animals, decomposing organic matter and faeces – all suspended in a structural net.  As an artistic medium, soil is often used decoratively or treated as a readymade – a found material that represents the `natural world`.  The detritus of contemporary human life – our phones, clothes, Styrofoam – are not the opposite of soil but its future components, just like the soil in the ancient Agora of Athens features fragments of urns, or the soil of Teufelsberg near Berlin is comprised of charred wreckage from World War II.  Right now, cities are unwittingly making new soil types, known as technosoils, in which these anthropogenic components are present. 
 My efforts to make new soil started with Absorption (2019), a work conceived for Kaldor Public Art Projects in Sydney, where debates about land and belonging are particularly urgent.  In the 330 tonnes of neo-soil created for both the Sydney iteration of Absorption and a smaller version of the work installed at Berlin`s Gropius Bau in 2020, the list of found materials included dune sand, legumes, cuttlefish bone from local beaches, spent beer barley, museum-café coffee, ashes from park BBQs, bricks, cardboard, clay, cocoa fibres, iron oxide, kaolin, ochre, rubble, sand, cotton clothing from Gropius Bau staff, hair from local salons, hemp fibres and shredded palettes from museum art handling.  Making a new soil felt like the right way to engage with the substance on a material level, rather than symbolically.  We were not creating a finished object, but a substance with a `life coefficient`: the ability to foster metabolic growth. 
 Just as animals once as omnipresent as oysters or krill can disappear if global water quality degenerates, so the disappearance of soil will doom most terrestrial life, turning our global political struggles about who owns what land into a dark, irrelevant joke.  Confronting this material requires you to consider the creation of soil to be more than mere decomposition and, conversely, to understand that our unearthing and processing of the landscape into differentiated molecules, which we`ve been doing with radically increasing speed, is not really composition, either.  Human politics generally offers two options, one positive and one negative: conservation of the way of life (conservatism) or thanatic destruction (revolution).  Soil implies a third, metabolic option, at once negative and positive. 
 Are these ramifying processes a form of entropy or the first stage of the creation of new life? Soil makes this distinction impossible.

DOING RIGHT ONLINE: ARCHIVISTS SHAPE AN ETHICS FOR THE DIGITAL AGE,Kritika Agarwal,https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/november-2016/doing-right-online-archivists-shape-an-ethics-for-the-digital-age,"This digital project brings together archivists, academics, and activists to create ethical standards for the archiving of tweets related to the Black Lives Matter and other social justice movements, so the matter of surveillance is not just a theoretical concern.  For those involved in DocNow, the possibility that their archival efforts will be used in police surveillance is an ethical matter they must confront.  the collections with social media content that we build might support law enforcement activity that targets groups of people they don`t agree with—for example, activists. ” As archivists forge practices for ethical online behavior, some are discovering new uses of digital technology that can rectify injustices associated with historic collection and archiving practices. 
 Michelle Caswell, who teaches archival theory at UCLA and cofounded the South Asian American Digital Archive, advises archivists to consider “whether the record creators and subjects of those records would consent to having them available digitally. ” While archivists typically seek consent to make materials publicly available for historical research, what makes the issue thornier in the case of digital collections is the expansion of the meaning of “the public. ” According to Caswell, it is one thing for a record to be available publicly in a repository, at which a researcher has to physically show up and request materials, and another for it to be searchable and discoverable by anyone in the world with an Internet connection.  To take one example, Reveal Digital, a website that uses a crowdfunded model to digitize archival collections, attracted criticism recently for digitizing back issues of the historic feminist lesbian porn magazine On Our Backs, held in special collections at Duke and Northwestern Universities. 
 I meant this work to be for my community, and now I am being objectified in a way that I have no control over. ” Another subject, who appeared on the cover of the magazine, worried that having the content freely available online would impact her professional career in the technology industry.  To address these issues, some archivists seek to explicitly gather consent from content creators before placing it online, and in doing so, they go above and beyond what is required of them under copyright law.  As a demonstration of how seriously it takes matters of consent, DocNow is working to create a system that would allow Twitter users to opt out of having their tweets archived, though they are publicly available. 
 Another ethical concern that goes hand in hand with consent is that of context—ensuring that digital materials presented online are not isolated from the circumstances in which they were created.  Instead of using an existing digital archival system and then working within its constraints, DocNow is letting ethical concerns drive its creation of technology.  An increasing number of archivists and scholars are now using digital tools and technology to confront ethical issues that have historically plagued collection and archiving practices.

KAMEELAH JANAN RASHEED ON LEARNING AND UNLEARNING,Nicole Acheampong,https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/interviews/kameelah-janan-rasheed-interview-reading-learning-unlearning-1234597485/,"The w in “weep,” in particular, is missing flecks of ink, and I know that Kameelah Janan Rasheed must have considered its acutely threadbare shape when she placed this word on the bottom right corner of an unnumbered page about three-quarters of the way through her 2019 book No New Theories.  Throughout the book, and across her art practice, Rasheed attends to text that is tentatively legible and partially withheld.  Rigorously interdisciplinary and a self-named “learner,” Rasheed often makes work in the form of immersive installations stuffed with scraps of text that she finds or writes.  Taking over surfaces like the facade of the Brooklyn Museum, a massive digital billboard in Times Square, or the walls and crevices of a gallery in Berlin, the artist makes architectural elements from poetic language, using her fine-tuned eye for typeface, color contrasts, and scale to bring viewers into a physically active reading experience. 
 Rasheed, born and raised in East Palo Alto, California, began as a high school teacher, after receiving a BA in public policy from Pomona College and a master`s in education from Stanford University.  Still working full-time in curriculum development, Rasheed intertwines her educational impulses with her artistic production, pairing exhibitions and book publishing with public lectures, workbooks, and on-site workshops.  Like the radical Black publishers who preceded her, Rasheed wants to own all the means of her production.  Rasheed is equally interested in algorithmic literatures—the language of artificial intelligence and text generation—and the juxtaposition of machine learning and predictive text with handwritten annotation. 
 When Rasheed mentioned understanding “myself,” the machine heard “my father,” coalescing the artist with the family member whose reading and note-taking process so closely resembles her own.  “Unlearning” became “I`m learning” became “unlearning” once more in the robo-transcription and in our actual conversation, as Rasheed enacted a close reading and generous rereading of her practice, her precedents, and her translation of complex, expansive care.  When I enter a space where my work will be displayed, I like to think about how people are going to move in that space.  If a space has many 90-degree angles, I can think about it as a book. 
 If a space has really high walls, it`s an opportunity for me to think about the affordances of such height and what I can do with wall painting and wall drawing.  Now I feel like my eleven-year-old self is resurfacing.  Scientific language is important to my art practice not because I believe that science is the only way to understand the world, but because I think of myself as an interdisciplinary person.
